/**
 * **The** renderer. Drawn identically by the GM preview and by the player window.
 *
 * ### Invariants
 *
 * Violating any of these breaks the "one state, two renderers" guarantee (§5, §10):
 *
 *  - never branch on which window it is being drawn in;
 *  - never take an aspect-ratio parameter — the **caller** sizes the box;
 *  - never branch on a size. `DrawScope.size` may be read to apply a *uniform scale*, so
 *    that content laid out at one virtual resolution is merely scaled to each target — see
 *    [drawInfoPanel] — but a size must never change *what* is drawn, how text wraps, or how
 *    many of anything there are;
 *  - never load an image without the caller's [model]. Coil keys its cache by request
 *    size, so a per-window default means two decodes that become ready at different
 *    moments — invisible with a hard cut, glaring through a dissolve. See
 *    [PlayerImageModel].
 *
 * ### Why fit/letterbox needs no code
 *
 * The black background paints the whole target surface; `ContentScale.Fit` scales the
 * bitmap by `min(boxW/imgW, boxH/imgH)` and centres it. The uncovered remainder *is* the
 * letterbox, and it is the same black (§13).
 *
 * `ContentScale.Fit` is scale-invariant: the geometry is a pure function of
 * `imageAspect / boxAspect`. So a 480 px preview and a 3840 px player window are
 * geometrically identical as long as both boxes share an aspect ratio.
 *
 * ### When crop, pan and zoom arrive
 *
 * Express them in **normalised [0,1] coordinates** on `VisualPresentation`, never in
 * pixels. A pixel offset means different things in a 480 px preview and a 3840 px window,
 * and the preview would quietly start lying about what the players see.
