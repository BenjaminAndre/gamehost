/**
 * What Brigade read out of a campaign note.
 *
 * Raw, not resolved — exactly the same split as [CampaignConfig]. Link targets are the
 * strings the GM wrote; turning «Métal» into an element, or a target into a [ContentId],
 * happens a layer up. It is what keeps `org.yaml` and `DocumentsContract` out of everything
 * above `content/saf/`.
 *
 * Note there is **no date**. The bar always shows the campaign date from `Campagne.md`
 * (§23), so a per-note `date:` would be read and never used — and a field that exists but
 * does nothing is worse than no field.
