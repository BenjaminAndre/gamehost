/**
 * A burning incense stick on the player surface.
 *
 * §14's composition model is `Scene { Visual, Audio, Overlay }`, and this is the Overlay:
 * something drawn *over* the presentation without replacing it. It is a sibling of the
 * visual, so changing slot, entering INFO or blanking leaves it burning untouched — which
 * is the only sensible behaviour for a timer the players are watching.
 *
 * ### How two windows burn in step
 *
 * Exactly as [ActiveTransition] does: the start time and the duration live in the state,
 * and each window computes what is left as a pure function of them while sampling its own
 * clock. Nothing ticks in the state, nothing drifts, and a player display reconnecting
 * mid-burn picks up the right length immediately rather than restarting.
 *
 * Never persisted. A timer is ephemeral to a session; restoring a stale one after a relaunch
 * would put a stick on screen that had already burnt out an hour ago.
