 * What Gamehost read out of `Campagne.md`.

 * happens later — this type only says what the file contained.
 *
 * That split is deliberate. The parser lives in `content/saf` because it needs a
 * `ContentResolver` and a YAML library; everything above it takes this plain data class and
 * stays free of both.
