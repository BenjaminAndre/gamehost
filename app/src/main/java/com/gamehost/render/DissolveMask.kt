/**
 * The noise field the watercolor dissolve washes through.
 *
 * ### Why a field and a threshold, rather than a shader
 *
 * AGSL `RuntimeShader` needs API 33 and the target tablet may be on 12, so the effect has
 * to be portable. Sweeping a threshold across a soft, irregular noise field and using the
 * result as an alpha mask gives the pigment-bleed look without one: the wash front follows
 * the noise contours instead of a straight line, which is the whole difference between
 * "watercolour" and "wipe".
 *
 * ### Process-wide, immutable, never null
 *
 * One field, generated once, held in a `by lazy` on an object. That matters more than it
 * looks: if the field could arrive *during* a transition, one window could still be
 * waiting for it while the other had already started washing — two render targets showing
 * different things, which is the §5 failure this architecture exists to prevent. An
 * immutable field that is always present cannot do that.
 *
 * Variation between consecutive dissolves comes from four dihedral orientations applied at
 * draw time (see [PresentationSurface]), not from a bank of fields. Two sign flips, no
 * plumbing, no readiness race — and nobody at a table has ever noticed a repeated dissolve
 * pattern anyway.
