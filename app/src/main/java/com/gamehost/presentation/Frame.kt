/**
 * One still picture of the player surface, fully determined.
 *
 * This is the type transitions are *between*, and it is why it exists at all: a
 * cross-dissolve has to hold two of these at once, and `VisualPresentation` could not
 * express "black" distinctly from "no image" — so a transition written against it cannot
 * tell blanking apart from an empty scene, and NOIR silently stops overriding anything.
 *
 * ### A Frame is resolved, not a recipe
 *
 * Anything requiring a locale, a calendar, a repository lookup or a font metric has
 * already happened by the time a Frame exists. The renderer may not do that work: it runs
 * twice, in two windows, and any of it could differ between them.
 *
 * Frame is also the ONLY resolved projection of presentation state. Nothing else may be
 * duplicated into it — it already restates [ScalingMode], which is a cost worth paying
 * once and not twice.
